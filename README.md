In this repository, we use BOW, CNN, lSTM and Transformers techniques to build a sentiment analysis model, data created in the first notebook are then used as input for the following notebooks. each model has its own pros and cons(ease of use, performance, gpu support), both tensorflow(keras) and pytorch are used.
